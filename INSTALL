Installation
============


Copy all the files to your favo(u)rite directory (e.g. /usr/local/webconvers)
and insert an include statement at the end of your httpd.conf file to
include webconvers.conf. Edit webconvers.conf so that the Alias path
points at the directory and restart the web server.

If a different alias is used, the sample html page will need to have the
javascript window parameter pointed at the correct directory. Watch out for
the cookie path in frame.php and options.php as well.

Make sure the server has the necessary PHP modules installed and loaded at 
runtime.

Edit config.php with the details of your host (CONVERS_GATEWAY), convers host 
(CONVERS_HOST), default login channel (DEFAULT_CHAN) and database path 
(CONVERS_PATH). 

Create the directory that CONVERS_PATH points to and make sure the web server 
user has access (apache:apache on my Gentoo system). Move the various .txt 
files to the database directory created above and edit as required.
The sample access control files may also be used - if they are not present 
the default access policy is used. The sample MOTD file can also be edited 
to reflect the local installation - note that this is actually PHP code!


Note that this package has only been tested with htpp1.22 and up convers 
servers. The column numbers used to split out the data in the user list 
may require adjustment with other servers. These values are in the file 
users.php. 


Thats it really.
