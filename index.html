<p><b><font size="+2">What is webconvers? </font></b>:</p>
webconvers is a web-based interface to the amprnet
World Wide Convers system that only requires a browser capable of supporting
frames. With the addition of Javascript (selectable by the installer or
by the user at login time) a lot of additional facilities become available
that improve performance through caching proxy servers, improved display
and more functionality. 
<br><big><b>NOTE:</b> this is <font color="#ff0000">not</font> a telnet or AX25 
gateway, it provides an interface into WW convers - thats all.</big>

<p>webconvers is written in the <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>
language, which is fairly cross-platform, and available for many different
web servers. The code is released under version 2 of the GPL.</p>
